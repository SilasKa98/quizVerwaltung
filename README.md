Imported or already existing questions can be additionally assigned to tags. For this, the user has a selection of existing tags. This makes it easier to find these questions afterwards.

The user has the possibility to compile his own collections (catalogs) of questions. For this purpose, he has the possibility to select any questions from the repository and to place them in a shopping cart-like structure. From there he can either create a catalog that is saved in his profile or export these questions directly from the shopping cart in one of the above mentionted formats. Of course he can export this catalog later as well.
